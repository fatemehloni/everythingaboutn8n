# Introduction to Generative AI

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content instead of only analysing existing data.
This content can include text, code, images, audio, or structured information.

Rather than following predefined rules, Generative AI learns patterns from large datasets and generates outputs based on context.
In modern software, it acts as a flexible intelligence layer embedded inside products and workflows.

## What is an LLM?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of Generative AI trained on very large amounts of text data.
Its main task is to predict the next token based on context.

Despite this simple objective, LLMs can perform complex tasks such as reasoning, summarisation, translation, and code generation.
They are the core engine behind most modern Generative AI applications.

## Ways to Work with LLMs

### Fine-tuning
Training a base model further on domain-specific data to adapt it to a specific use case.

### Prompt Engineering
Designing clear and structured instructions to guide the model’s behaviour and output.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Connecting LLMs to external knowledge sources so responses are grounded in real data.

### Agents
LLMs that can plan, take actions, and use tools across multiple steps to achieve a goal.

## Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt

A well-structured prompt usually includes:
- A clear role
- A specific task
- Relevant context or constraints
- A defined output format

### Example

You are a technical documentation writer.
Summarise the following text in 5 bullet points.
Use simple language and avoid marketing terms.
