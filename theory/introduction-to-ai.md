# Introduction to AI

## Overview
This section gives a short and practical introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
The goal is not theory-heavy definitions, but enough context to understand how AI is used in automation tools.

## Why AI is important?

As Andrew Ng said:
"Just as electricity transformed almost everything 10 years ago, AI will now do the same"

## Key Points
- AI refers to systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence
- It focuses on learning, reasoning, and decision-making
- AI is widely used in modern software products

## The AI Value Framework

The AI value framework helps explain where AI creates real value in software products.
Instead of focusing on models or algorithms, it focuses on outcomes.

At a high level, AI delivers value by enhancing intelligence inside systems:
- Automating decisions
- Improving accuracy over time
- Reducing manual effort
- Enabling scalable personalisation

AI is most valuable when embedded into workflows rather than used as a standalone feature.
In this setup, AI supports human decisions instead of replacing them.

## Relation to n8n
n8n uses AI as a building block inside workflows, not as a standalone system.
